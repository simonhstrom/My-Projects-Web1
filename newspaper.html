          <h2>Ford Mustang S650</h2>

          <p>
            2022 is the last year of the current, S550-generation Ford Mustang.
            In March 2023, the next S650 generation of the pony car is going to
            hit the road. Both the 2.3-liter EcoBoost and 5.0-liter Coyote V-8
            are available. However, they will be part of a hybrid system. This
            could also mean all-wheel drive for the S650 Mustang, but at this
            point, it is too early to tell. The 10-speed automatic is expected
            to make a comeback, but nothing is being said about the manual
            version, yet. Ford is keeping a tight lip about the extent of
            hybridization, but it’s almost certainly going to be a plug-in or a
            full hybrid.

          <h2>2023 Aston Martin V12 Vantage</h2>
          <img

            alt="Aston martin"
          />
          <p>
            While the entire Aston Martin lineup benefits from refreshes for the
            2023 model year, few are as exciting as the limited edition V12
            Vantage. As the name implies, there is more going on than fancy
            bodywork. For the first time since the last generation, the famous
            Aston Martin 5.2-liter twin-turbo V12 finds its way into Aston
            Martins' smallest coupe. The car's design is a farewell to the V12
            with a limited edition run of just 330 vehicles, with a price tag
            surpassing $300,000. However, the staggering base MSRP is not enough
            to dissuade Aston Martin loyalists, as the order book for North
            America is already closing. While this will not be the last V12 put
            into an Aston Martin, it will be the last one in a Vantage. An
            electric successor to the current Vantage is due in 2024.

          <h2>Corvette C8 Z06</h2>
          <img
            src="https://www.auto-data.net/images/f94/Chevrolet-Corvette-Coupe-C8.jpg"
            alt="Corvette"
          />
          <p>
            The coveted Z06 badge returns to the Corvette in 2023 with the
            performance to match. While many historic Corvette fans are still
            slow to accept the mid-engine C8, several attributes will lend to
            helping consumers embrace the new flagship. The Z06 features the
            highest naturally-aspirated V8 ever built, with 670 horsepower going
            to the rear wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission. A 0-60
            time of 2.6-seconds proves that the V8 isn't quite ready to be put
            out to pasture and is in line with many hybrid and electric
            supercars that utilize the instant torque of electric motors to
            attain such quick off-the-line times. The starting MSRP of $103,300
            also gives consumers a lot of car for the money. Production for the
            Z06 kicks off in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in a few months.

          <h2>Bmw m2</h2>
          <img
            src="https://cdn.bimmertoday.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2023-BMW-M2-G87-Toronto-Rot-04.jpg"
            alt="Bmw-m2"
          />
          <p>
            The M2 is all-new for the 2023 model year. It packs the automaker’s
            twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter straight-six S58 engine. It delivers 453
            horsepower (333 kilowatts) and 406 pound-feet (550 Newton-meters) of
            torque to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual gearbox. The
            eight-speed automatic M Steptronic transmission is available as an
            option. The 2023 M2 is scheduled to go on sale in the US in April
            2023. That same month BMW plans to add a second shift at the
            factory, adding 500 jobs. When it arrives, the M2 will have a
            $63,194 starting price (all prices include the $995 destination
            charge). The car’s price can reach over $77,000, and that’s before
            adding any of the M Performance parts available for the coupe, which
            are abundant for the new model.

          <h2>Porsche 911 GT3 RS</h2>
          <img

          />
          <p>
            Whether you're cruising the smooth city streets or tackling the
            twisty bits along our country roads, Porsche wants to ensure you can
            reach everywhere quicker. So it further optimized what many already
            considered a perfect street car into a legal track car that is the
            2023 Porsche 911 GT3 RS. Inspired by the Le Mans class-winning 911
            RSR racecar, which also influenced the 911 GT3 R design, the 2023
            911 GT3 RS features a single centrally positioned radiator – the
            first road-legal Porsche 911 to do so (other models have a
            three-unit layout) – that gave Porsche engineers the wiggle room to
            fine-tune both sides of the front end for better aerodynamics and
            exhilarating performance. This, alongside the car's aerodynamic
            package, helps create about 902 pounds of downforce at 124 mph,
            which is three times as much as the regular 911 GT3.

          <h2>BMW M3 Touring</h2>
          <img
            src="https://static.cdn-expressen.se/images/6f/2a/6f2a2f00a67b4e35b803733e3668d4d2/16x9/2560.jpg"
            alt="BmwM3"
          />
          <p>
            If you’re looking for a leading-edge luxury wagon that brilliantly
            combines exceptional driving performance with practicality and a
            striking design, then the 2023 BMW M3 Touring could well be the car
            for you. The new wagon version of the M3 is available only in
            Competition guise with a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder
            engine making 503 hp and 479 pound-feet of torque. Acceleration from
            0 to 62 mph takes just 3.6 seconds, while top speed is limited to
            155 mph in the base model. Opting for the M Driver’s Package raises
            the maximum speed to 174 mph. An eight-speed automatic gearbox is
            standard, as is a dynamic all-wheel drive system. There's no manual
            transmission for this model. The M3 Touring is the first performance
            wagon from BMW and will compete for a market share against the
            equally stellar Audi RS4 Avant.

          <h2>Honda Civic Type R</h2>

          />
          <p>
            It's hard to justify having a list of the hottest new performance
            cars coming in 2023 without mentioning the Civic Type R, which has
            traditionally been an exhilarating yet thoroughly pleasurable
            vehicle to drive. Available exclusively in hatchback configuration,
            the 2023 Honda Civic Type R features a turbocharged 2.0-liter
            four-cylinder that puts out 315 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque –
            the most of any Civic ever sold in North America. This means the
            all-new 2023 Type R gets nine more hp and a 15 lb-ft improvement in
            torque compared to the previous model. Honda says the performance
            gain results from a revised turbocharger, an increased air intake
            flow rate, and a new, more efficient exhaust system that keeps
            motoring costs down.

          <p>
            Engaging driving experience has always been a Z Car specialty, and
            the all-new 2023 Nissan Z seeks to uphold these standards with
            numerous improvements that will keep you entertained. There is lots
            of power on tap when you need to tackle the highway with pace,
            thanks to a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 that pumps out 400
            horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels
            only via either a six-speed manual or a nine-speed automatic
            transmission with paddle shifters on the steering wheel. It might be
            heavier than the old 370Z it replaces, but the new Z Car feels
            well-adhered to the pavement as it instantly reacts to steering
            inputs.

            alt="AMG-c43"
          />
          <p>
            The 2023 C43 is a great performance sedan with the precise handling,
            balance, and poise that only a few vehicles can provide. It benefits
            from a hand-crafted turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that pumps
            out a whopping 402 horsepower – 17 more hp than the 3.0-liter
            twin-turbo V6 in the previous C43. The powertrain is assisted by a
            48-volt hybrid system that can temporarily add 13 more horsepower
            for short bursts. From a standing start, the C43 reaches 60 mph in
            4.6 seconds.

          <h2>Toyota GR Corolla</h2>
          <img
            src="https://www.vibilagare.se/public/styles/media_image/public/2022-04/corolla0.jpg?itok=jithndDD"
            alt="ToyotaGR"
          />
          <p>
            The GR Corolla is a well-handling hot hatch that feels far more
            powerful and responsive than its pint-sized proportions may at first
            suggest. It delivers astronomic levels of output courtesy of a
            300-hp 1.6-liter turbocharged 3-cylinder engine borrowed from the GR
            Yaris. This robust power is delivered to all four wheels through a
            6-speed manual transmission that is so quick that it enables you to
            go from zero to 60 mph even faster, in just 4.99 Seconds, compared
            to the Yaris' 5.5 seconds. The manual is the only transmission of
            choice. Despite its impressive punch, the all-new GR Corolla still
            has much room left for a comfortable onboard experience. Its cabin
            blends high-quality fit and finish with cushioned relaxation from
            the adjustable driver's seat, plenty of features, and modern gadgets
            that help make every experience behind the wheel interesting.
